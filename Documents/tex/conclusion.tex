\chapter*{Conclusion}

Our research presents the evolution of hash functions. Due to great advances in their cryptanalysis over the past decade. It is necessary to move away from the underlying constructions most hashing algorithms relied on up until recently: the Merkle Damg\r{a}rd construction.\\
In recent years, significant advances in the field of hash function research have led to the birth of a whole new class of hash functions, based on the sponge construction.\\
With the advance of differencial cryptanalysis,  hashing algorithms such as SHA1 and MD5 are no longer deemed cryptographically secure.\\
And despite the fact the SHA-2 family of functions is still considered secure, inherent weaknesses in the Merkle Damgard underlying constructruction imply that sponge functions such as SHA-3 seem safer than previous ones.\\
Thus it would seem coherent to move directly towards SHA-3, instead of SHA-2. But such a migration is not easy due to legacy systems. Therefore, one wonders how and how fast new cryptographic standards can be applied on existing structures, such as TSL or the Bitcoin cryptocurrency (based on SHA-256). Can such a migration occur without impacting these systems ?\\
