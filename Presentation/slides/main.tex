Subject: Virus on the Arpanet - Milnet
<Stoll@DOCKMASTER.ARPA> Thu, 3 Nov 88 06:46 EST

Hi Gang!

It's now 3:45 AM on Wednesday 3 November 1988. I'm tired, so don't
believe everything that follows... Apparently, there is a massive
attack on Unix systems going on right now.

I have spoken to systems managers at several computers, on both the
east & west coast, and I suspect this may be a system wide problem.
Symptom: hundreds or thousands of jobs start running on a Unix system
bringing response to zero.

[...]

This virus is spreading very quickly over the Milnet. Within the past
4 hours, I have evidence that it has hit >10 sites across the country,
both Arpanet and Milnet sites. I suspect that well over 50 sites have
been hit. Most of these are "major" sites and gateways.

[...]

This is bad news.
